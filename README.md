# NgTaskMan

## Install Notes
Node Version 20.15.0 \
Recommend using the "Node Version Manager" \
After Downloading Run the following:
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```
*Note --legacy-peer-deps is required for the datepicker. It's a good component, however, it needs to be updated. 

Install The Angular-Cli Version 19.2.7
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli@19.2.7
```

## Evaluation Notes
A lot of the files are generated by the Angular CLI, however the code created for evaluation is primarily in the src/app directory specifically the 'components','models' and 'services' sub-directories.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files. \
To use another port such as 4242

```bash
ng serve --port 4242
```
then navigate to `http://localhost:4242/`
